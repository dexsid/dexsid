## 👋 Yo, I'm Aslan

💻 Self-taught developer on the grind. I mix code with chaos and learn on the way.  
🚀 Big on crazy ideas, small steps daily — I code after 12-hour warehouse shifts, 'cause why not.  
🛠️ From backend to mobile dev, from design in Figma to editing reels — I do it all.  
🤝 Team player, silent killer — I don’t talk much, but I get sh*t done.  
🎯 Dream? Help my fam, fix the house, send pops to the sea. Until then — code, hustle, repeat.

> 💬 Let's build something weird, smart, and useful.
